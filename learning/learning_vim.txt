regex 
  /\v  or ?\v to search with very magic mode

  :[range]s/find/replace/flag(s)
  :[range]s/\vfind/replace/flag(s)  to use very magic mode
    very magic only changes find behavior not replace

  in very magic. things are special by default
    get the literal by escaping 
    ex. /\v\/home\/*   matches /home/*

  strings types
  .     everything
  /d    digits
  /w    words
  /s    whitespaces

  matching amounts
  *     0 or more
  +     1 or more
  ?     0 or 1

  ()    group 
  |     alternate, OR
    \v(foo|bar)   matches foo or bar
  {m,n} ranges
    \v\d{3)     matches exactly 3 digits (123)
    \v\d{2,4)   matches 2 - 4 digits (12 123 1234)
    \v\d{3,)    matches 3 or more (123 1234 12345 ...)
    \v\d{,3)    matches up to 3 (1 12 123)
    \vab{,3)    matches ab abb abbb
    \v(ab){,3)  matches ab abab ababab

  :s/foo/bar/    replace first foo in the current line
  :%s/foo/bar/   replace all foo in the line
  :%s/foo/bar/g  replace all foo in the file

  flags
  g    global
  i    ignore case
  I    case sensitive
  c    confirm replacing for every match
  n    count matches that would happen (dont replace)

  modifying replace 
    capture group to reuse 
    :s/\v(\w+)\s+(\w+)/\2 \1/  swap adjacent words

  &,\0     everything that matches 
  \1,\2    captured group
  \u\1     capitalize first leter
  \U\1     capitalize the entire group
  \l\1     lowercase first leter
  \L\1     lowercase the entire group
  \E       stop \u \U \l \L and continue replacing
    :%s/\v(w+)/\L\1\E done/   replace "wORd" with "word done"

    :%s/\v(w+)/\u\1/g    capitalize every words

  context
    \zs  start matching here
      everything before this is context
    \ze  end matching here
      what comes after is context

    :%s/\vfoo\zsbar/baz/    replace bar in foobar with baz
    :%s/\vfoo\zsbar\zequx/baz  replace bar in foobarqux with baz
